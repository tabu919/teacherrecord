Teacher Record Management System

The Teacherâ€™s Management System is an essential digital tool for organizing teaching activities. It helps the institute to store data of the teachers with respective subjects.
While keeping track of lesson plans can be used as a helpful resource for you, there are also benefits to sharing lesson plans and working with other teachers.

For example, other teachers may be able to give tips on how they tackled different subjects with their students or be able to coordinate assignments depending on how classes are structured.
